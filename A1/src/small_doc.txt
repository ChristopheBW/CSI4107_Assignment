Wasserman's control comes more from the respect he commands than from the stock he controls.
Wasserman owns 6.9 percent of MCA's stock and controls another 8.9 percent through a series of trusts, including those of the family of MCA founder Jules Stein.
From its beginning as a Hollywood talent-booking agency, MCA has grown into a powerhouse in producing movies, television programming, records and toys.
